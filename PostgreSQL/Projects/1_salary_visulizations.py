When looping through: zip(bars, df_top_10_sorted['job_location']) â€” it is assumed that bars 
and df_top_10_sorted['job_location'] are in exact same order and alignment. However, when you call ax.bar(...)
and use hue='job_title_short', Seaborn actually creates grouped bars and manages them as multiple sets, 
so the bars list only includes one bar per hue group. This meant zip(bars, df_top_10_sorted['job_location']) 
 may only loop through a subset of all rows, usually just the second hue category 
 (in this case "Senior Data Scientist"), so only their locations were drawn. Zip was aimed to pair the bars and the job
 title together.

 To attend to this issue, paired together each bar from the chart (ax.patches) and the corresponding data row 
 from sorted dataframe (df_top_10_sorted.iterrows()), so that the bar's height and x-position to place text and
 use the row's corresponding 'job_location' as the content of the label.
